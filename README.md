# UFOs
### Overview
The client, Dana, wanted to create a website using JavaScript that documented UFO sightings. In order to provide a more in-depth analysis of the data, Dana wants me to create filters for multiple criteria at the same time. These filters include the date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO encounters.

### Results
The first objetive was to create more table filters for the user to input data into. Additional list elements were inserted into the HTML and JavaScript files for city, state, country, and shape. The results are seen below.

The second objective was to create a filtered table based on the user's input in the filter search box. An example image is below that shows what is filtered when a user inputs the city of Cary in North Carolina.

### Summary
With the filter search updated, there are still many issues and improvements that the website could use. One improvement it could use is a better explanation of the types of shapes that are used to describe the UFO sightings. Some are described as triangles and circles, while others use words like fireball and light.

One recommendaton to improve the website is add an improved date search filter. The current filter requires you to enter an exact day, month, and year for UFO sightings. Many users would probably be interested in sightings by year instead. Another recommendation would be to add a photo section to the table so users would be able to see if the people who witnessed the sightings were able to take a picture of the incident or the location where they saw the UFO.
